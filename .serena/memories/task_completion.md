# Task Completion Checklist
- Run `make fmt-check` and `make lint` when applicable to ensure formatting and linting pass.
- Execute `make test` (or targeted `poetry run pytest <path>`) to verify all tests succeed.
- Summarize key changes, affected files, and validation steps in final response.
- Highlight remaining risks or follow-up work; provide next-step suggestions (e.g., deployment, monitoring).
- Avoid reverting user-made changes; coordinate on merge/commit steps if requested.
